    <h2>What is being called a “praline”?</h2>
    <p>
      In semantic terms in the <em>French language</em>, a <span class="important">praline</span> refers to an almond or hazelnut coated confectionery with caramelized sugar.
      Note that the term <span class="important">“praline” is Belgian in its origin</span>.
      In Belgium, a <span class="important">“praline”</span> is defined by a chocolate candy with a filling. 
      In France, they talk about small, round chocolates <em>“crotte de chocolat”</em> to describe what the Belgians call pralines.
      It should be added that there are as many definitions of pralines as there are techniques for making them.

    <h2>Pralines are getting modernized</h2>
    <p>
      Master chocolate makers continue to improve the recipe, for example adding new flavors such as <span class="important"><em>gianduja,</em></span> a subtle mixture of toasted dried fruits and white sugar.
      This praline is in between marzipan due to the white sugar and nut paste with its addition of dried fruit.
      The little extra is the adding of cocoa butter or chocolate.
      The <span class="important"><em>ganache</em></span> version uses <em>crème fraiche</em> and chocolate as well as ingredients such as liqueur, tea or fruit.
      If you prefer <span class="important">truffles,</span> note that this is a sweet mix of butter, melted sugar and chocolate usually accompanied by liqueur.
     </p>

    <blockquote><span class="important">To evaluate the quality of a praline:</span>
      <br>Look at its color, its shine and its consistent shade. Have a look as well if the surface is fine and regular and if it breaks cleanly.
      As for the smell, it should give off the main flavor followed by the filling before concluding with the taste of chocolate and not of sugar.
